You can observe the actual impact (for example, conversion rates) of your biased assignments and at the same time calculate, *from the same experiment*, an unbiased, model-free estimate of what the conversion rate for a purely random assignment would have been, using a mathematical technique called ERUPT or policy value.  This means that beyond the usual learnings from an A/B/N test you now have a precise, unbiased estimate of the benefit that biasing the assignment has brought. \n",
